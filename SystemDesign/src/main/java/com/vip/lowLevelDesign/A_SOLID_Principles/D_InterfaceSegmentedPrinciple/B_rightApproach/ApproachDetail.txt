Suppose we have a restaurant, we want to perform some operation on the employee of the restaurant, so we won't make an interface
which have
                    -> takeOrder()
                    -> serveCustomer()        we shouldn't use generic interface instead we should use employee generic interface


                    "So that there won't be any unnecessary implementation of interface method"
