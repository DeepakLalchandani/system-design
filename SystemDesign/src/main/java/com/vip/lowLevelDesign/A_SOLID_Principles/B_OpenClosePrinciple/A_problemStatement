Question: Suppose we have a class name "Book" it have it's needed attributes, now we have a
            class name "Invoice","InvoicePrint" and "InvoiceSave" which basically perform only 1 major function

              Invoice           -> calculateTotal
              InvoicePrint      -> printInvoice
              InvoiceSave       -> saveTheDataToDB

            Now we want to "add one more method" to 'InvoiceSave' -> saveTheDataToFile *
            SO WE CAN SAY WE WANT TO MODIFY 'InvoiceSave'  CLASS, Suggest a correct
             way of implementing this?

 Answer: We will gonna use SOLID's principle's O(Open/Closed principle) -> it says
                  "OPEN FOR EXTENSION BUT CLOSE FOR MODIFICATION"

                  see the solution in 'B_rightApproach' package
