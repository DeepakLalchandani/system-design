Question: Suppose we have a class name "Book" it have it's needed attributes, now we have a
            class name "Invoice" which basically perform 3 major function

                    -> calculateTotal
                    -> printInvoice
                    -> saveTheDataToDB
            Now we want to change  1.  "calculateTotal" because of some new GST rule
                                   2.  "printInvoice" with some extra data set
                                   3.  "saveTheDataToDB" to saveIntoS3
            SO WE CAN SAY WE WANT TO CHANGE ALL THE 3 METHODS PRESENT in this Invoice class, Suggest a correct
             way of implementing this?

 Answer: We will gonna use SOLID's principle's S(Single Responsibility Principle) -> it says
                  "A CLASS SHOULD HAVE ONLY 1 REASON TO CHANGE"
