We will create a class "Laptop" then we will directly call the keyboard class and mouse class and set it to the laptop using
constructor injection.

But this approach is wrong, what if we want to change the type of keyboard and mouse.

        -> to do so we have to make change in this class itself, which is not a very neat approach
